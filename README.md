# ThinkSharp 🧠💡

**ThinkSharp** is a personal challenge project focused on improving my critical thinking and software design skills using the C# programming language and object-oriented principles.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Sharpen problem-solving and design skills
- Practice algorithms and design patterns in isolation
- Improve speed and clarity in thinking through code
- Remove distractions from frameworks, UIs, and databases
- Create a collection of shareable, teachable solutions

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Each challenge is a self-contained console application (or script)
- Focus is on clarity, structure, and testable logic
- Real-world inspired scenarios (e.g., eBook sales, task schedulers, etc.)
- Solutions may include patterns like Factory, Strategy, or Decorator

## 🧪 Example Topics

- Sale and delivery of digital goods
- Booking/reservation systems
- Payment calculations
- Scheduling or queuing logic
- Inventory and pricing engines

## 👨‍🏫 For Learners

This repository is also built with future teaching in mind — clear structure, meaningful names, and sharable design rationale. If you're learning or teaching, feel free to fork or build on it.
